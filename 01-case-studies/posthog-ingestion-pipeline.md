# How PostHog Ingests and Processes Events – A TPM Case Study

## 🔍 Overview

PostHog is an open source product analytics platform that helps teams capture, visualize, and act on user behavior data. It competes with tools like Mixpanel, Segment, and Amplitude.

A core part of PostHog’s product experience is its ability to ingest and process millions of events from client-side and server-side SDKs with low latency and high reliability.

This case study reverse-engineers PostHog’s ingestion pipeline — breaking down how it works, the technical tradeoffs involved, and the product implications of system design choices. It is written from the perspective of a Technical Product Manager responsible for scaling and evolving this part of the stack.
